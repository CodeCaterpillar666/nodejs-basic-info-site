# nodejs-basic-info-site
This is an assignment from [The Odin Projeft](https://www.theodinproject.com/) &mdash; [PROJECT: BASIC INFORMATIONAL SITE](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/full-stack-javascript/courses/nodejs/lessons/basic-informational-site).

Basically what I am doing here is use the http module from NodeJS to create a static server that is able to response to different url and send corresponding html file back.
